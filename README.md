# Basic Covid-19 Vaccine Record Checker
Given the complexities of dealing with a large number of staff submitting files which need to be checked for authenticity, this project is meant to provide a quick turn around for those who need a shallow check that the correct file has been submitted.

## Building executables
The project uses npm and the module `pkg` to build executables. 

To build executables:
1. Install npm
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `npm i` within the repository
4. Run `npm run create`

## Using the executable
1. If you are going to be using this project for images (and not just pdfs) you will need to download and install tesseract onto your machine. If you are on a ***windows machine*** you can use [this resource to help you](https://medium.com/quantrium-tech/installing-and-using-tesseract-4-on-windows-10-4f7930313f82)

2. Copy the executable into a folder with images and pdf files of covid vaccination passes.
3. Run the executable
4. Files will be moved into *valid* and *invalid* directories with a summary spreadsheet.

## Future improvements
* Integrating with NHS Services to dynamically check secure 2D barcodes generated by COVID Pass.
